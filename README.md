# UNIT 2 - Salma Bhar
# Braille Counting Project
## Criteria A: Planning
### Context of the problem
This project is a program to count from 0 to 9. The preceding has been done last year with the current G12s who used the standard 7 figures to count. Therefore, this year's G11s will have to think outside the box and come up with more creative ways to create a program with the purpose of counting while using the same criteria and resources. We will dispose of: <br>
- 7 LEDs <br>
- 4 Buttons <br>
- Arduino <br>
- Circuits components <br>

### Justification of the solution
I will create a program dsiplayed on LEDs which counts from 0 to 9 in braille language when we press different combinations of buttons. As for hardware, I am using 4 LEDs, 4 buttons and an Arduino. It is worth noting that only 4 LEDs will be used out of the 7 provided which optimizes this solution even further. Moreover, I will be using C++ as a software language since it is the primary coding language for the Arduino and we have had practise sessions during class in that language. In fact in 2017, C++ ranked 4th among 24 other programming languages in September [1] due to its fast processing and several built-in functions. The program will be first run on the simulator Tinkercad to avoid damaging the physical components when testing the solution. <br>

### Criteria for success
1. There are no bugs in the program <br>
2. Provides clear signage of the counting <br>
3. Full Documentation on GitHub <br>

## Criteria B: Design
### System Diagram
We drew the following system diagram in class: <br>

### Initial Sketches
These are braille numbers:

I drew the initial idea of the system in a sketch:

## Criteria C: Devolepment
I started with a truth table of the 4 LEDs: a, b, c, d.

Then I traced the K-maps of each of the 4 LEDs.
